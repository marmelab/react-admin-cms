# react-admin-cms

## Installation

Install the application dependencies by running:

```sh
make install
```

Please note that you will need a [React-Admin Enterprise license](https://react-admin-ee.marmelab.com/#pricing) to install dependencies, as I used the `<ReferenceManyToManyInput>` and `<ReferenceManyToManyField>` components from the React-Admin Enterprise edition.

## Development

Start the application in development mode by running:

```sh
make start
```
